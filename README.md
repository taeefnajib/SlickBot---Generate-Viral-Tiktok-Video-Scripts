## Output: Bar Edition (20-30 seconds)

**Scene:** A dimly lit bar, upbeat music playing in the background.

**Characters:**

* **Bartender** (20s, cool and collected)
* **Customer** (20s, visibly nervous)

**(Video starts with a close-up shot of a cocktail shaker being shaken vigorously. The camera pans to the Bartender, who smoothly pours a bright pink drink into a martini glass.)**

**Bartender:** (Smirking) First time ordering a drink?

**(Camera cuts to the Customer, who's fidgeting with their phone and avoiding eye contact.)**

**Customer:** (Stuttering) Uh... maybe. What gave it away? The fact that I'm reading the drink menu upside down?

**(The Bartender raises an eyebrow playfully. Camera zooms in on the drink menu, which is indeed upside down.)**

**Bartender:** Could be that. Or maybe it's the fact you're wearing noise-cancelling headphones... in a bar.

**(The Customer sheepishly takes off their headphones. Upbeat music cuts out abruptly. Awkward silence.)**

**Customer:** (Whispering) Is it too late to order a water?

**(The Bartender bursts out laughing. Camera focuses on their reaction for a beat.)**

**Bartender:**  Tell you what, I'll make you something even better. Trust me?

**(The Bartender winks at the camera. Video ends with a shot of the mysterious drink being prepared, overlaid with text: "What do you think's in it? ðŸ¤”  #bartenderlife #firsttimedrinker #awkwardmoments")**
